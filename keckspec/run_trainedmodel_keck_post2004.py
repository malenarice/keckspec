    # ---------------------
    #
    # INPUTS:
    # normalized_flux:
    #   - Continuum-normalized fluxes
    #     at each wavelength, with
    #     dimensionality
    #     (number of stars, 64336)
    # normalized_ivar:
    #   - Inverse variances (1/sigma^2)
    #     associated with each flux
    #     measurement, with
    #     dimensionality
    #     (number of stars, 64336)
    # save_file (optional):
    #   - Default: True
    #   - Optional choice to save file
    #     or just return labels as an array
    # star_names (optional):
    #   - Default: None
    #   - Provide an array of star names for easier
    #     readability of code outputs
    # save_dir (optional):
    #   - Default: Saves file in current directory
    #   - Choose directory in which results
    #     are saved
    #
    #
    # OUTPUTS:
    # df_results:
    #   - labels as a Pandas dataframe
    #     with size (number of stars, 18) where
    #     there are 18 labels returned
    # ** If save_file == True:
    #    -> Saved .csv file providing results
    #       with size (number of stars, 18)
    #
    #
    # NOTES:
    #   - Wavelengths must be interpolated
    #     to the training set wavelength
    #     scale. Echelle orders placed in
    #     order from highest to lowest
    #     wavelength
    #   - The total number of
    #     wavelength values is 64336:
    #     4021 wavelengths x 16 echelle
    #     orders, where echelle orders
    #     are placed side by side
    #   - Contact the author (Malena Rice)
    #     if your wavelength range is smaller
    #     than that used in this model
