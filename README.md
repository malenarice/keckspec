This package is designed to output 18 stellar labels from input Keck HIRES spectra. The labels returned are Teff, logg, vsini, [Fe/H], [C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H], [Al/H], [Si/H], [Ca/H], [Ti/H], [V/H], [Cr/H], [Mn/H], [Ni/H], and [Y/H]. The user inputs the fluxes and inverse variances at each wavelength value, and label estimates are outputted. 

To obtain reliable results, the input fluxes MUST be reported at wavelength values that match up with those that were used to train our supervised learning algorithm. To support the user, we have provided an interpolation scheme that will convert spectra to this wavelength range.
