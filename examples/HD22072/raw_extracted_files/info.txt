The files in this folder include the raw extracted fluxes and the associated wavelengths, uncertainties, and continuum fit for HD 22072. These are provided both as "flattened" files (1D arrays with 64336 entries, where each echelle order has been placed side by side) and as the unflattened versions with dimensions (16, 4021) for the 16 echelle orders. The continuum fit provided here was obtained using a legacy continuum fitting code described in Valenti & Fischer 2005.
